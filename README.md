# AB_test_sample
Sample AB Test Analysis

We have run an AB test in the onboarding section of an app, adding in a carousel wheel for new customers.
We have a CSV file with key events from new customers, which we will analyse in this notebook. 

Potential Benefits
In-app carousel wheel should help new users discover more information and how to best use the app.

Potential Drawbacks
But, they are based on sequential access and are often not obviously discoverable. This can make the information difficult to uncover. Users may find it disengaging, resulting in dropouts.
